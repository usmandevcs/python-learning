# VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT 
'''
An environment which is same as the system interpreter but 
is isolated from the other Python environments on the system. 
simple alfaz kahy to virtual environment ma hum aik clone
bnaty hain interpreter ka jisme ma hum same alg modules, 
function install kar k chala skty hain. iska globle interpreter 
se koi link nhi hota.
'''

# INSTALLATION 
# To use virtual environments, we write: 

# pip install virtualenv  # Install the package 

# We create a new environment using: 

# virtualenv myprojectenv # Creates a new venv 

# To activate:
        # \virtual_environment ka name\scripts\activate.

'''
The next step after creating the virtual environment is to 
activate it. 
We can now use this virtual environment as a separate Python 
installation. 
'''

# PIP FREEZE COMMAND  
'''
‘pip freeze’ returns all the package installed in a given 
python environment along with the versions. 
'''
# pip freeze > requirements .txt 
'''
The above command creates a file named ‘requirements.txt’ in 
the same directory containing the output of ‘pip freeze’. 
We can distribute this file to other users, and they can 
recreate the same environment 
'''
# using: 
# pip install –r requirements.txt
